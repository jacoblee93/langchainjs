```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
import { BufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";
import { PromptTemplate } from "langchain/prompts";

const DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = `The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:
{history}
Human: {input}
AI:`;

const prompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(DEFAULT_TEMPLATE);
const model = new OpenAI({});

const chain = prompt.pipe(model);

const memory = new BufferMemory();

const currentMemoryState = await memory.loadMemoryVariables({});

const chainInput = { input: "Hi! I'm Jim." };

const res1 = await chain.invoke({ ...currentMemoryState, ...chainInput });

await memory.saveContext(chainInput, { output: res1 });
```

here's what's going on under the hood

```console
> Entering new chain...
Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:

> Finished chain.

>> 'Hello! How are you today?'
```

Now if we run the chain again

```typescript
const res2 = await chain.call({ input: "What's my name?" });
```

we'll see that the full prompt that's passed to the model contains the input and output of our first interaction, along with our latest input

```console
> Entering new chain...
Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:  Hello! How are you today?
Human: I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.
AI:

> Finished chain.

>> "Your name is Jim."
```
