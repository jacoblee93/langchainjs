# Summarization

A summarization chain can be used to summarize multiple documents. One way is to input multiple smaller documents, after they have been divided into chunks, and operate over them with a `MapReduceDocumentsChain`. You can also choose instead for the chain that does summarization to be a StuffDocumentsChain, or a RefineDocumentsChain. See more about the differences between them [here](../index_related_chains/document_qa)
